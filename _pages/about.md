# About Me

Hello! I’m **Kewei**, currently pursuing my Master’s degree at **The University of Hong Kong**. Prior to that, I graduated from "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen". My research mainly concentrates on 3D vision and graphics. I currently work on topics about 3D AIGC including 3D neural representations, 3D generative models, and 3D-aware video generation.

## Let’s Connect

I thrive on interdisciplinary collaboration and love discussing novel ideas—whether it’s a new architecture for mesh generation, a faster solver for time-dependent PDEs.  
Feel free to reach out via email: **kewei.shi@connect.hku.hk**
