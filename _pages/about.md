# About Me

Hello! I’m **Kewei**, currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science at **The University of Hong Kong**.

## Research Focus

- ### Generative Models (2D & 3D)  
  Designing and training models that can synthesize realistic images, point clouds, and meshes—bridging the gap between data-driven deep learning and traditional graphics pipelines.

- ### Shape Representation  
  Investigating compact, expressive ways to encode geometry (e.g., implicit functions, signed distance fields, neural radiance fields) so that 3D objects can be stored, manipulated, and rendered with high fidelity.

- ### Numerical Methods for PDEs  
  Applying finite-difference, finite-element, and spectral techniques to solve partial differential equations arising in physics-based simulation, geometry processing, and volumetric reconstruction.

## Broader Interests

- **Computer Vision & Graphics**: From image understanding to photorealistic rendering  
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Exploring reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and emerging LLM/vision hybrids  
- **Electronics & Embedded Systems**: Prototyping sensors and hardware accelerators for real-time perception  
- **AI for Physics**: Delving into the mathematical foundations of the universe and computational astrophysics  

## Let’s Connect

I thrive on interdisciplinary collaboration and love discussing novel ideas—whether it’s a new architecture for mesh generation, a faster solver for time-dependent PDEs.
